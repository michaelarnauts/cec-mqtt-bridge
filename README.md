cec-mqtt-bridge
===============

A HDMI-CEC / IR to MQTT bridge written in Python 3 for connecting your AV-devices to your Home Automation system. You can control and monitor power status and volume.

# Features
* CEC
  * Power control
  * Volume control
  * Power feedback
  * Relay CEC messages from HDMI to broker (RX)
  * Relay CEC messages from broker to HDMI (TX)
* IR
  * Relay IR keypresses from IR to broker (RX)
  * Relay IR keypresses from broker to IR (TX)

# Dependencies

## MQTT (required)
* MQTT broker (like [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/))

## HDMI-CEC (optional)
* libcec4 with python bindings (https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec)
  * You can compile the bindings yourself, or use precompiled packages from my [libcec directory](libcec/).
* HDMI-CEC interface device (like a [Pulse-Eight](https://www.pulse-eight.com/) device, or a Raspberry Pi)

## IR (optional)
* lirc + hardware to receive and send IR signals
* python-lirc (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lirc/)

# Configuration

You can either copy `config.default.ini` to `config.ini` and adjust its properties, or alternatively declare any of those as environment variables using the format `SECTION_KEY` (e.g., `MQTT_USER`).

# Lirc

You need a `lircrc` config file. This can be generated from the `lircd.conf` of your lirc daemon using the script `create_lircrc.py`.
Simply call this script with the `lircd.conf` path as first argument.
It will print the lircrc contents to stdout and can be easily written to a file:
```
$ ./create_lircrc.py /etc/lirc/lircd.conf > lircrc
```

If you write your own lircrc file, notice that the `config` parameter for each configuration is what is given to the bridge.
It is assumed that it is in the format `<remote>,<key>`.
If only one value is given, the remote is expected to be omitted.

The lircrc format (that would be generated by the `create_lircrc.py` script) should look like:
```
begin
  remote = <remote-name>
  button = <key-name>
  prog = cec-ir-mqtt
  config = <remote-name>,<key-name>
end
```

To only get the key (without the remote name in the MQTT topic) use the format without the remote in the `config`:
```
begin
  remote = <remote-name>
  button = <key-name>
  prog = cec-ir-mqtt
  config = <key-name>
end
```


# MQTT Topics

The bridge subscribes to the following topics:

| topic                   | body                                    | remark                                           |
|:------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `prefix`/cec/`id`/cmd   | `on` / `off`                            | Turn on/off device with id `id`.                 |
| `prefix`/cec/cmd        | `mute` / `unmute` / `voldown` / `volup` | Sends the specified command to the audio system. |
| `prefix`/cec/tx         | `commands`                              | Send the specified `commands` to the CEC bus. You can specify multiple commands by separating them with a space. Example: `cec/tx 15:44:41,15:45`. |
| `prefix`/ir/`remote`/tx | `key`                                   | Send the specified `key` of `remote` to the IR transmitter. |

The bridge publishes to the following topics:

| topic                   | body                                    | remark                                           |
|:------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `prefix`/cec/`id`       | `on` / `off`                            | Report power status of device with id `id`.      |
| `prefix`/cec/rx         | `command`                               | Notify that `command` was received.              |
| `prefix`/ir/`remote`/rx | `key`                                   | Notify that `key` of `remote` was received. You have to configure `key` AND `remote` as config in the lircrc file.  |
| `prefix`/ir/rx          | `key`                                   | Notify that `key` was received. You have to configure `key` in the lircrc file. This format is used if the remote is not given in the config file.  |

`id` is the address (0-15) of the device on the CEC-bus.

# Examples
* `mosquitto_pub -t media/cec/volup -m ''`
* `mosquitto_pub -t media/cec/tx -m '15:44:42,15:45'`
